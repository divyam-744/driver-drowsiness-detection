# driver-drowsiness-detection
Driver drowsiness detection is a system designed to prevent accidents by monitoring a driver's condition and detecting signs of fatigue or sleepiness. This system is particularly useful in transportation, where long driving hours can lead to driver fatigue and accidents. 

## Algorithms Used:
-Face Detection: Algorithms like Haar Cascades or modern deep learning models (e.g., MTCNN).

-Eye State Detection: Methods like Hough Transform, Support Vector Machines (SVM), or CNNs to recognize if eyes are closed for too long.

-Head Pose Estimation: Predicts if the driverâ€™s head is tilting excessively, using key point detection or facial landmark models.

## Applications:
-In passenger vehicles for personal safety.

-In trucks and commercial fleets, where driver fatigue is a significant safety concern.

-Integrated with autonomous vehicle systems for improved safety in semi-autonomous driving environments.
